17 Jun 2024WWDC 24 is over, and I decided to start writing posts about new features in the upcoming iteration of the SwiftUI framework. Apple continues filling gaps this year by introducing more granular control over the scroll position. This week, we will learn how to manipulate and read the scroll offset.

**Enhancing the Xcode Simulators.**  
Compare designs, show rulers, add a grid, quick actions for recent builds. Create recordings with touches & audio, trim and export them into MP4 or GIF and share them anywhere using drag & drop. Add bezels to screenshots and videos. [Try now](https://gumroad.com/a/931293139/ftvbh)

The SwiftUI framework already allows us to track and set the scroll view position by view identifiers. This approach works well but is not enough to track user interactions more accurately.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position: Int?
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                ForEach(0..<100) { index in
                    Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                        .id(index)
                }
            }
            .scrollTargetLayout()
        }
        .scrollPosition(id: $position)
    }
}
```

Fortunately, the SwiftUI framework introduced the new _ScrollPosition_ type, allowing us to combine the scroll position by offset, the edge of the scroll view, view identifier, etc.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Button("Scroll to bottom") {
                position.scrollTo(edge: .bottom)
            }
            
            ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                    .id(index)
            }
            
            Button("Scroll to top") {
                position.scrollTo(edge: .top)
            }
        }
        .scrollPosition($position)
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we define the _position_ state property and use the _scrollPosition_ view modifier to bind the scroll view with the state property. We also place two buttons allowing you to quickly scroll to the first or latest items in the scroll view. The _ScrollPosition_ type provides the _scrollTo_ function with many overloads, allowing us to handle different cases.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Button("Scroll to bottom") {
                position.scrollTo(edge: .bottom)
            }
            
            ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                    .id(index)
            }
            
            Button("Scroll to top") {
                position.scrollTo(edge: .top)
            }
        }
        .scrollPosition($position)
        .animation(.default, value: position)
    }
}
```

We can easily animate programmatic scrolling by attaching the _animation_ view modifier by passing an instance of the _ScrollPositions_ type as the _value_ parameter.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Button("Scroll somewhere") {
                let id = (1..<100).randomElement() ?? 0
                position.scrollTo(id: id, anchor: .center)
            }
            
            ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                    .id(index)
            }
        }
        .scrollPosition($position)
        .animation(.default, value: position)
    }
}
```

Here, we have added another button to change the position of the scroll view to a random item. We still use the _scrollTo_ function of the _ScrollPosition_ type, but instead of an edge, we provide a hashable identifier. This option allows us to change the position to a particular item, and by using the _anchor_ parameter, we can choose the point of the selected view that should be visible.

Last but not least is the overload of the _scrollTo_ function with the _point_ parameter, allowing us to pass an instance of the _CGPoint_ to scroll the view to the particular point of the content.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Button("Scroll to offset") {
                position.scrollTo(point: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 100))
            }
            
            ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                    .id(index)
            }
        }
        .scrollPosition($position)
        .animation(.default, value: position)
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, we use the _scrollTo_ function with a _CGPoint_ parameter. It also provides overloads, allowing us to scroll the view only by the _X_ or _Y_ axis.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {            
            Button("Scroll to offset") {
                position.scrollTo(y: 100)
                position.scrollTo(x: 200)
            }
            
            ForEach(1..<100) { index in
                Text(verbatim: index.formatted())
                    .id(index)
            }
        }
        .scrollPosition($position)
        .animation(.default, value: position)
    }
}
```

We learned how to manipulate the scroll position using the new _ScrollPosition_ type, which also allows us to read the position of the scroll view. The _ScrollPosition_ provides the optional _edge_, _point_, and _viewID_ properties to read the value when you scroll programmatically.

Whenever the user interacts with the scroll view, these properties become **nil**. The _isPositionedByUser_ property on the _ScrollPosition_ type allows us to understand whenever the user gesture moves the scroll view content.

Today, we learned how to programmatically set the offset of the content in a scroll view. However, we can’t read the offset of the scroll view using the _ScrollPosition_ type whenever a user interacts with a scroll view using a gesture.

To make it possible, the SwiftUI framework provides us with the _onScrollGeometryChange_ view modifier we will cover in the next post. I hope you enjoy the post.
